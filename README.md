This repository is for a _Godot Engine Plugin_ that allows showing the ads offered by **AdMob** in an **easy** way, without worrying about the building or version, **just download and use**.

The **purpose** of this plugin is to always keep **up to date with Godot**, supporting **ALMOST ALL** versions from v4.1+, and also make the code **compatible** on **Android and [iOS](https://github.com/poingstudios/godot-admob-ios)**, so each advertisement will work **identically on both systems**.

### üîë Key features

- It's a wrapper for [Google Mobile Ads SDK](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/sdk). üéÅ
- Easy Configuration. üòÄ
- Supports nearly all Ad Formats: **Banner**, **Interstitial**, **Rewarded**, **Rewarded Interstitial**. üì∫
- GDPR Compliance with UMP Support. ‚úâÔ∏è
- Targeting Capabilities. üéØ
- Seamless integration with Mediation partners: **AdColony**, **Meta**, **Vungle**. üí∞
- CI/CD for streamlined development and deployment. üîÑüöÄ
- Features a dedicated [Godot Plugin](https://github.com/poingstudios/godot-admob-plugin), reducing the need for extensive coding. üîå
- There is also an [iOS plugin](https://github.com/poingstudios/godot-admob-ios) available, which has the same behavior. üçé


## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èHow to use 
- We recommend you to use the [AdMob Plugin](https://github.com/poingstudios/godot-admob-plugin), you can download direcly from [Godot Assets](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2063).
- After download, we recommend you to read the [README.md](https://github.com/poingstudios/godot-admob-plugin/blob/master/README.md) of the Plugin to know how to use.

## üì¶Installing:

### üì•Download
- To get started, download the `poing-godot-admob-android-v{{ your_godot_version }}.zip` file from the [releases tab](https://github.com/Poing-Studios/godot-admob-android/releases). We recommend checking the [supported Godot version](https://github.com/Poing-Studios/godot-admob-versions/blob/master/versions.json) before proceeding. You can also use the [AdMob Plugin](https://github.com/Poing-Studios/godot-admob-plugin) for this step by navigating to `Tools -> AdMob Download Manager -> Android -> LatestVersion`.
- As of Godot 4.2+ the architecture for [Android Plugins](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/platform/android/android_plugin.html) has changed and now properly supports `EditorExportPlugin`. That means no more `.gdap` files. Instead, place the directory `google_admob` from `editor_export_plugin` inside your `addons` folder in your Godot project. You can choose your preferred language (C# or GDScript) so both don't need to be added. Then it can be enabled from the export template just like before.
- To get started, download the `poing-godot-admob-android-v{{ your_godot_version }}.zip` file from the [releases tab](https://github.com/poingstudios/godot-admob-android/releases). We recommend checking the [supported Godot version](https://github.com/poingstudios/godot-admob-versions/blob/master/versions.json) before proceeding. You can also use the [AdMob Plugin](https://github.com/poingstudios/godot-admob-plugin) for this step by navigating to `Tools -> AdMob Download Manager -> Android -> LatestVersion`.

### üßë‚ÄçüíªUsage
- Video tutorial: https://youtu.be/WpVGn7ZasKM.
- Enable Android Build Template. [Check the tutorial here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/android_custom_build.html).
- Inside `poing-godot-admob-android-v{{ your_godot_version }}.zip` you downloaded, you will face some folders like `'ads'`, `'adcolony'`, `'meta'`, `'vungle'`. To AdMob works only `'ads'` is required, but if you want [Mediation](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/13420272?hl=en), you need the other folders.
- Move the content inside the folder which you need into ```res://android/plugins``` directory on your Godot project.
- Add your [AdMob App ID](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/7356431) to your app's ```res://android/build/AndroidManifest.xml``` file by adding a ```<meta-data>``` tag with name ```com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID```, as shown below. If you don't do this then you App will crash on start-up.

``` xml
<!-- Sample AdMob app ID: ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713 -->
<meta-data
	android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
	android:value="ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx~yyyyyyyyyy"/>
```
- Export the project enabling the `Use Custom Build` and `Ad Mob`, if you have Mediation, also mark `Ad Mob Meta`, `Ad Mob AdColony` etc...
