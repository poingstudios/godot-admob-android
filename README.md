This repository is for a _Godot Engine Plugin_ that allows showing the ads offered by **AdMob** in an **easy** way, without worrying about the building or version, **just download and use**.

The **purpose** of this plugin is to always keep **up to date with Godot**, supporting **ALMOST ALL** versions from v4.2+, and also make the code **compatible** on **Android and [iOS](https://github.com/poingstudios/godot-admob-ios)**, so each advertisement will work **identically on both systems**.

### 🔑 Key features

- It's a wrapper for [Google Mobile Ads SDK](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/sdk). 🎁
- Easy Configuration. 😀
- Supports nearly all Ad Formats: **Banner**, **Interstitial**, **Rewarded**, **Rewarded Interstitial**. 📺
- GDPR Compliance with UMP Support. ✉️
- Targeting Capabilities. 🎯
- Seamless integration with Mediation partners: **AdColony**, **Meta**, **Vungle**. 💰
- CI/CD for streamlined development and deployment. 🔄🚀
- Features a dedicated [Godot Plugin](https://github.com/poingstudios/godot-admob-plugin), reducing the need for extensive coding. 🔌
- There is also an [iOS plugin](https://github.com/poingstudios/godot-admob-ios) available, which has the same behavior. 🍎


## 🙋‍♂️How to use 
- Video tutorial: https://youtu.be/WpVGn7ZasKM.
